# Vectors & Matrix

### Learning Objectives

### Vector

* A vector, in programming, is a type of array that is one-dimensional.
* For example, \[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is a vector.

### Matrix

* Matrix is an arrangement of numbers into rows and columns.

* The matrix A has two rows and three columns.

### Shape of Matrix

* Since matrix A has two rows and three columns, we write its shape as $2\times3$, pronounced as ‘two by three’.

### Dimension of Matrix

* The shape of the matrix also tells you its dimensions. The dimension of matrix A is two as its shape is $2 \times 3$.
* If a matrix has a shape, say, $2\times3\times2$, the dimension of the matrix would be 3.
* Don’t worry if you don’t get this point. It will become more apparent as you go along.

### Matrix

* Matrix B has three rows and two columns, so it is a $3\times2$ matrix

* Whenever you are working with matrix shape, remember rows$\times$columns
