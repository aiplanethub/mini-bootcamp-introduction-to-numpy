### Using Negative Single Index

* Using negative indexing on 1-D array
* Pass the negative index of the element in a square bracket [ ].

* Using negative indexing on 2-D array
* Pass the negative index of the element in a square bracket \[].
* Try executing num\_arr\[-1]\[-2] in your notebook

### Negative Index Intervals

* Now you have an idea about how index intervals work on a NumPy array.
* You also have an idea about how negative indexing works on Python lists.
* See the snippet shown here. Can you think of how to get the output in yellow box using negative indexing? Try doing this on your own first.
