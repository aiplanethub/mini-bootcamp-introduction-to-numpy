### Learning Objectives

* What is NumPy?
* Why NumPy?
* Importing NumPy

### What is NumPy?

* NumPy stands for Numerical Python.
* It is an open-source Python library.

### Use of NumPy

* It is used for working with numerical data in Python.

### Why NumPy?

* Makes the numerical computations easier and faster
* Consumes less memory

### Import NumPy

Anytime you want to use a library in Python, the first step should be to make it accessible.

You can import/load NumPy in your notebook or any other Python IDE in two different ways.

**`import numpy`** \
OR \
**`import numpy as np`**

We will be using **np** shorthand for NumPy. It simply serves as an alias, making it easier to use np instead of writing ‘numpy’ while coding.

Note: In this bootcamp, we will use `import numpy as np`.
